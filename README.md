# Nest Examples

A collection of examples to introduce you to nest. 

I recommend you go through each example in order as each example builds on the concepts introduced in the previous one.

* [Example 1](./example-1) - Basic introduction to nest generators to create a module
* [Example 2](./example-2) - Add a controller to your basic module.
* [Example 3](./example-3) - Creating a service.
* [Example 4](./example-4) - Create a resolver and expose graphql endpoints along with your rest routes.
* [Example 5](./example-5) - Use the concepts from the previous four examples to create a simple todo CRUD app using rest and graphql.
* [Example 6](./example-6) - Basic introduction to dynamic modules and custom decorators.
